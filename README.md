# Web-Design-Challenge

We are making a website in this one! Our [Python-API](https://github.com/LongPatrol/python-api-challenge) challenge was not challenging enough, so we decided to make some webpages for the project. 

We have a main homepage with some background. There is a navigation bar at the top for a few of the webpages, and a side navigation bar (VizLinks) which uses the charts themselves as the link to those pages:

The chart pages each have a the relationship being studied, and a short explanation of what is happening there. Our Comparison page allows the user to look at the four charts together to be able to compare them to each other. Finally, the data page has the data that was used to put these charts together.
